## Rails frontend
- Interactively play with a TM
- Plot the fitness over time
- Json web service (use CouchDB?)
- Submit an organism

## Database
- Genome
- Fitness score

## GA
- Chromosome specification
- Selection/crossover/mutation techniques and probabilities
- Prune unreachable states
- Subgraph isomorphism problem
- - Comparing to a known UTM
- - Detecting identical organisms
- A connected set of states should be actual
- Select for adaptable - change the fitness function, or use some
  convex combination of fitness functions.
- Catastrophe

## Fitness functions
- Ability to imitate a benchmark TM (that changes periodically)
- Complexity of output
