\subsection{Project division}

The project was devided into two main parts: The genetic algorithm optimization and the results visualization. The work load was split evenly between team members, but each section was managed by lead. Josh Lee led on the genetic algorithm implementation and Neil Sandberg led the web visualization implementation. The genetic algorithm implementation required the larger development efford, and Josh Lee and Steven Dee focused their efforts on this development, with algorithm design support provided by Justin Gray. Neil developed the initial web visualation tool and Justin Gray contributed to the final data representation design and implementation. 

Each of the two parts was developed in parallel, using a database as the data bridge between them. By using a simple database design that was fixed early on, the task of integration of the two parts was greatly simplified. 

All work was performed collaboratively using a github source repository. The project is stored in an open source repository at http://github.com/mrdomino/utm/. The repository was used to store all files regarding the implementation of the genetic algorithm and the web visualization tool.
