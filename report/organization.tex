\subsection{Project division}

A first priority will be to define a standard format for representing a Turing Machine; this format will be used pervasively in the entire application. From there, several independent modules fall naturally out of the problem specification:

\begin{itemize}
\item Execution: Given a TM and its input, returning successive states of the tape at points in the future. (Josh Lee)
\item Evaluation: Determining a heuristic for universality, ranking TMs, and producing stochastic test data. (Justin Gray, Steven Dee)
\item Breeding and mutating: The GA's selection and combination processes. (Neil Sandberg)
\item Web based visualization tool, using Ruby on Rails. (Justin Gray, Neil Sandberg)
\end{itemize}

It is our expectation that, since these modules have well-defined interfaces and can be tested independently of each other, we will be able to work on them individually or in pairs, depending on the size of the task. The responsible parties are listed next to each module

\subsection{Communication}

We will use a mailing list to coordinate communication for the group. Justin Gray will serve as the point of contact for the group as a whole. Github will be used as a source repository to enable distributed collaboration.
