\subsection{Project division}

A first priority will be to define a standard format for representing a turing machine; this format will be used pervasively in the entire application. From there, several independent modules fall naturally out of the problem specification:

\begin{itemize}
\item Execution: Given a TM and its input, returning the final state of the tape.
\item Evaluation: Determining a heuristic for universality, ranking TMs, and producing stochastic test data.
\item Breeding and mutating: The GA's selection and combination processes.
\end{itemize}

It is our expectation that, since these modules have well-defined interfaces and can be tested independently of each other, we will be able to work on them individually or in pairs.
