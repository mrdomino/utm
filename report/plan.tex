In order to complete the project, we will need to construct a genetic
model for Turing Machines. For this, we will need an encoding of Turing
Machines in some serial format; a method of scoring Turing Machines that
favors universality; and a genetic algorithm that fits the problem. In
order to actually see our results, we will also need some way of
visualizing them.
