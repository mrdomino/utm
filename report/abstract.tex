We propose to investigate Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection, in abstract, by analyzing the results of a Genetic Algorithm optimization on a population of Turing Machines. Using the Turing machines as analogs for simple organisms, the goal of the research is to perform an optimization where the result is a population which contains some Universal Turing Machines. We take Universal Turing Machines to represent more complex organisms on an evolutionary path. We will include a web based visualization environment, written in Ruby on Rails, to help visualize the results of the optimizations.
