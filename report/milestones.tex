Figure \ref{fig:gantt} shows a detailed timeline for the completion of the project. The major milestones for all aspects of the project present, including necessary work for the creation of an optimization scheme to search for UTMs as well as the creation of a web based visualization tool to facilitate the examination of the project results. The key to the task names used in Figure \ref{fig:gantt} is presented below: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Encoding}:	Definition of the encoding method for Turing Machines completed
	\item {\bf Chromosome}: Implementation of the chromosome class for the AI4R Genetic Algorithm package completed.
	\item {\bf O(n)}:	Computational cost for fitness evaluation of a Turing Machine is determined.
	\item {\bf MPI/GA Decision}:	Decision made regarding necessity of use for MPI along with AI4R\nocite{AI4Rmanual} Genetic Algorithm to reduce computation time.
	\item {\bf Literature Search}: Literature search to generate a list of known UTMs
	\item {\bf Initial Results}: Initial Turing Machine Optimization run completed. Data analyzed to ensure the viability of optimization scheme
