Figure \ref{fig:gantt} shows a detailed timeline for the completion of the project. The major milestones for all aspects of the project present, including necessary work for the creation of an optimization scheme to seach for universal turing machines as well as the creation of a web based visualization tool to faciliate the examination of the project results. The key to the task names used in Figure \ref{fig:gantt} is presented below.
